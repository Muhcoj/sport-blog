Ajax produced a stunning Champions League display this week to knock holders Real Madrid out of the tournament and progress to the quarter-finals.

The Dutch side's stylish 4-1 win in the Bernabeu, to seal a 5-3 aggregate win, evoked memories of the last of their teams to conquer Europe.

In 1995, Louis van Gaal's side beat AC Milan 1-0 in Vienna thanks to an 85th-minute goal from substitute Patrick Kluivert.

But can you name their starting XI for the game, pictured above?

You have three minutes...
