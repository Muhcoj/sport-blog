        <h1>Ajax David Neres</h1>
<p>09 Mar 2019 - </p>

<p>After scoring in the match which saw his countryman injured, the attacker is in line for his first cap for the Selecao
Ajax star David Neres is set to make his senior team debut for Brazil after he was called into the squad as an injury replacement for Real Madrid attacker Vinicius Junior.</p>

<p>Both young Brazilians were in the starting lineup for their respective clubs on Tuesday as Real Madrid hosted Ajax in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.</p>

<p>It was a night to forget for the defending champions as the Amsterdam club overturned a 2-1 first-leg defeat with a 4-1 victory at the Bernabeu â€“ a result made worse when Vinicius was forced off with a severe calf injury that will keep him out for most of the remainder of the season.</p>
