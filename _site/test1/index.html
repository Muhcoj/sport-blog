        <h1>Ajax Matthijs de Ligt</h1>
<p>09 Mar 2019 - </p>

<p>Ajax defender Matthijs de Ligt has talked up a move to Liverpool by admitting a transfer to Jurgen Klopp’s side ‘could happen’. The 19-year-old is expected to be one of the most in-demand players during the upcoming transfer window following his sublime performances for Ajax. De Ligt, who is valued at £60 million by the Dutch club, has been linked with several top European clubs including Barcelona, Manchester City and Liverpool. De Ligt has played alongside Virgil van Dijk for Netherlands national side and the centre-back has suggested he would welcome the chance to continue that partnership at club level. ‘Virgil is a player who has experience in the top leagues,’ De Ligt told Omnisport.</p>
